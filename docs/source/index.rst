Frank!Manual
============

This is the user manual of the Frank!Framework, an open-source platform to quickly build enterprise applications. To have an enterprise application, or as we say a Frank, you have to deploy the Frank!Framework in combination with XML configuration files. This manual explains to Frank developers how to develop Frank configs (chapters :ref:`gettingStarted` and :ref:`advancedDevelopment`). Operators or site owners can read chapter :ref:`operator` about monitoring and managing a Frank. System administrators can learn how to deploy a Frank on their infrastructure (chapter :ref:`deploying`). There is also material about  :ref:`testing`.

If you have remarks or questions about the Frank!Framework, please go to GitHub Discussions: https://github.com/frankframework/frankframework/discussions.


The Java source code of the Frank!Framework can be found at https://github.com/frankframework/frankframework. You can also find release notes here, see https://github.com/frankframework/frankframework/releases. See also http://frankframework.org for more information.
