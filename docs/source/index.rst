Frank!Manual
============

This is the user manual of the Frank!Framework, an open-source platform to quickly build enterprise applications. To have an enterprise application, or as we say a Frank, you have to deploy the Frank!Framework in combination with XML configuration files. This manual explains to Frank developers how to develop Frank configs (chapters :ref:`gettingStarted` and :ref:`advancedDevelopment`). System administrators can learn how to deploy a Frank on their infrastructure (chapter :ref:`deploying`). There is also material about  :ref:`testing`.
