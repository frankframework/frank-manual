.. _deploymentTomcat:

Apache Tomcat
=============

This section explains how to manually deploy a Frank on an Apache Tomcat application server. It is a tutorial and presents instructions that you can follow to deploy a Frank. You get the opportunity to get hands-on experience. You can also read along without following instructions. All information you need will be provided in this text.

There are two tutorials. Subsection :ref:`deploymentTomcatBasic` gives you a basic understanding of deploying on Apache Tomcat. That tutorial uses an in-memory database, which is good for your development environment but not on production. The next tutorial :ref:`deploymentTomcatDatabase` demonstrates how to manually configure an external database.
