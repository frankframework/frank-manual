Getting Started
===============

This chapter introduces you to the basic features of the Frank!Framework. If you are a Frank developer, please study this chapter before investigating more advanced topics. If you are a tester, you can study our product Ladybug without reading this chapter; see :ref:`ladybug`. If you are a system administrator, you can study :ref:`deploying` without reading this chapter.

This chapter can be studied in two ways. First, it is a tutorial. There are instructions that you can follow to get hands-on experience with the Frank!Framework. You will use the Frank!Runner, to be found at https://github.com/ibissource/frank-runner. Second you can just read the text on your laptop or even your telephone.

If you have questions or remarks about the Frank!Framework, then please visit https://github.com/frankframework/frankframework/discussions.

If you want, you can download the solution :download:`configuration <../downloads/configurations/NewHorizons.zip>`.
