.. _testSpecific:

Test-specific ignore
====================

In the previous sub-subsection we demonstrated global ignores. In tab "Debug" we opened Options | Transformation and updated the XSLT transformation we found there. We saved our updated transformation in file :code:`updatedTransformation.xsl`.

In this sub-subsection we demonstrate that this global XSLT transformation is not saved along with your test reports. After this, we do a test-specific ignore.

Please do the following:

.. highlight:: none

#. In Ladybug, go to tab "Test" (number 1). Press "Download all" (number 2). Finish the file save dialog to save your tests. We will refer to this file as :code:`savedTestsAfterTransformation`.

#. Stop the Frank!Framework. Go to the tests directory within your Frank2Manual directory. Within the tests directory there should be files satisfying pattern "Pipeline \*.report.xml". Delete them.
#. Restart the Frank!Framework. Open Ladybug and go to tab "Test" (number 1 in the figure below). Press "Upload" (number 2) and select file :code:`savedTestsAfterTransformation`. Finish the dialog. This restores your tests.

#. Go to tab "Debug" (number 1 in the figure below). Press "Options" (number 2) and "Transformation" (number 3). You can see that the change you did earlier is not restored (number 4).

#. We will not restore the global transformation, but we will examine test-specific ignores. Go to tab "Test" (number 1 in figure below). You can see that your uploaded test is present (number 2).

   .. image:: tabTestAfterUpload.jpg

#. Press "Open" (number 3). You see the figure below. You are in a new tab (number 1). Select the topmost "Pipeline" node in the tree view (number 2).

   .. image:: afterUploadPrepareEdit.jpg

#. Press "Edit" (number 3). You see the figure below. The tab stays the same (number 1). Select the topmost "Pipeline" node (number 2). Then copy the contents of file :code:`updatedTransformation.xsl` to the clipboard. This is the updated XSLT transformation you had earlier in the Options | Transformation dialog.

#. Paste the XSLT transformation from the clipboard to the Transformation field (number 3). Press "Save" (number 4) and "Close" (number 5).

   .. NOTE::

      In the Options | Transformation dialog, a default XSLT transaction was available. It had comments telling you how to update the transformation. The edit screen of a test report has an empty Transformation field. It is good to know that you can paste the transformation from Options | Transformation there.

#. You are back in tab "Test" (number 1 in the figure below). Press "Reset" (number 2) and the "Run" button of your test report (number 3). You see that your test succeeds again (number 4).

   .. image:: runWithTestSpecificTransformation.jpg

#. Press "Compare" (number 5). The screen becomes as shown below. You are in tab "Compare" (number 1). Select the topmost "Pipeline" node (number 2). You see the text "RETRIEVALTIME-IGNORED", both to the bottom-left and to the bottom-right (numbers 3 and 4).

   .. image:: testWithLocalTransformationSuccessComparison.jpg

#. Please save your test reports. The updated transformation will now be included. We will refer to your saved test scripts as ``savedTestsWithNewTransformation``.
