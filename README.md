# Frank!Manual

This project documents the Frank!Framework for software integration. The Frank!Framework itself is hosted on GitHub at https://github.com/frankframework/frankframework. The audience for this manual about the Frank!Framework is developers, testers and system administrators. Please read this manual on http://frank-manual.readthedocs.io to learn more about the Frank!Framework.

This project contains restructured text files with explanations and Frank configs that complements these explanations. Restructured text files are plain text files with extension .rst. These files should be processed by the Sphinx tool to produce the formatted manual. This is achieved using the website http://www.readthedocs.io. This GitHub repository has a Git hook pointing to that site, triggering an automated build each time a commit is added. The result can be read at https://frank-manual.readthedocs.io/.

The Frank configs that complement the explanations have three purposes. First, Frank configs are provided as the solutions of tutorials. Some sections of the manual request the reader to create a Frank config and try it. These sections provide a download link for the expected result. Second, editors of the manual should check statements about the Frank!Framework using examples. These examples also appear within this git project. Finally, system administrators and testers need to work with the Frank!Framework without writing Frank configs themselves. Tutorials for testers and system administrators therefore provide Frank configs to exercise with.
